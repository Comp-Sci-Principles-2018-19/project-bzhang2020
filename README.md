## Problem

## Big Fat Idea
 There would be a main character who should overcome all kinds of problems such as starving and unknown attackings. In the end of the game, this main character could survive and get a new life in his future. . the game would have several single steps and each step would have two choices. If the player chooses the right one, player can skip into next step; If player chooses the wrong one, he would lose or die. 
 

## First Agile Iteration
The main character wakes up under a broken bridge. He would find a box under the bridge and he has to choose the tools in there. After that, he would face two ways and he has to choose one way to escpe the broken bridge. After that, he would see some animals which are aggresive and he needs to choose to fight them or flee away....
